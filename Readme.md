# Restaurant Management System

- Designed and implemented a SQL-based Restaurant Management System, creating essential tables and data structures.  
- This involves creating tables for Bill, Booking, Cashier, Cook, Customer, Delivery boy, Home delivery, Ingredient, Manager, Menu, Menu bill, Owner, User, Waiter.  
- I implemented advanced features such as foreign key constraints, data truncation, and modification of column properties to optimize database performance and maintain consistency.
- Performed Insert, complex joins, updates, deletes and queried data to ensure the integrity and smooth functioning of the database.
